  I made a rock paper scissors project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I lead a team of 3 people, I worked on most of the games major functions such
  as determining the winner, draw or a loser, and all possible scenarios. I also worked on the game modes with my team mate who helped me 
  add games modes suchas best of three or first point wins.

  I worked on an instagram clone project. The project required me to build a webpage that was aesthetically a clone of instagram with some working
  functions. The webpage looked similar but also had the ability to log in and log out with the help of local storage and it would change the name
  from user to the logger's name. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and bootstrap for this.

  I worked on also worked on a wordle clone project. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for that project. The project basically
  worked the same as any regular wordle game. The game utilized a random 5 word generator because that was the limit I set for the words
  lengths so we don't have to enter a new word every game.
