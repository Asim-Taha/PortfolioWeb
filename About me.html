<h3>
My Name is Taha Asim and I am a 3rd year computer science student at York University. Computer Science is a program that I am genuinely very
excited to have a career in. I like to keep up with the latest tech and being a student of this program has kept me interested in this industry
even more. Apart from school, I enjoy reading books, one of my favourite books of all time is The Humans by Matt Haig. I would rather not 
spoil it for you. Another good one, a very popular one is Rich dad poor dad. I also enjoy Watching football(Soccer), TV-shows and movies etc.
