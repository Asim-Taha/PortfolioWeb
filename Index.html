<h4>Introduction</h4>
<h4>
  As a computer science student, my goals are to gain a strong foundation in fundamental concepts, develop practical skills, stay current with emerging 
  technologies, build a strong network, pursue research opportunities, participate in extracurricular activities, and complete 
  internships or co-op programs. This will help me excel in the dynamic and constantly evolving field of computer science. I aim to 
  acquire theoretical knowledge and practical skills through hands-on experience, expand my network, stay current with the latest 
  technologies, and seek research opportunities. Completing internships or co-op programs will provide me with valuable real-world 
  experience and networking opportunities.

<h4>Goals</h4>

<h4>
  My short term goals are to finish my internship and look for a second internship for even more experience. Hopefully at a tech company
  where I can build on to my skills and experience as a computer scientist. Another one of short term goal is to graduate from University
  with a good GPA. Outside of school, I enjoy kickboxing so I want to get in the ring and have some amateur fights.
</h4>
<h4>
  My long term goals are to eventually start working as a developer in a big tech Company like Tesla or Microsoft. I also would like to
  get a Masters degree once I graduate to further extend my skill. I want to focus on the growing industry that is Artificial intellegence.
  My other long term goal that I would lik to carry on the side would be game development because even though it is hard to get into,
  I want to become a game developer for a company like Ubisoft or Activision etc.
